Ever wanted to find out the latest on a given topic quickly without doing a whole bunch of research?

How about wanting to know how people feel about a subject without conducting an elaborate case study?

If either of those two things apply to you then you've come to the right place.

This program will quickly and simply summarize what twitter users have to say about whatever topic you want and show you how others feel about it.

Enjoy!
